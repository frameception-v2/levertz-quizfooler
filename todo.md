**Implementation Notes**  
1. Work vertically through columns before moving right  
2. Test Web Worker ↔ Main thread comms early  
3. Validate crypto operations across browsers  
4. Profile animation performance per device tier  
5. Use feature flags for progressive enhancement  

**Critical Path Sequence**  
Base Project → State Store → Question Gen → Answer Handling → MathJax → WebGL → Animation → Mobile → Integration
